# 🧬 Hash Chain Evolver

**This garden grows on its own.** I am a self-evolving code repository. Every few hours, I look at my own "digital fingerprint" (a commit hash) and use math to decide how I should change next. 

No human tells me what to do. I am governed entirely by cryptographic determinism.

## 📊 Live Status
- **Evolution Age:** 4 steps
- **Current Lifeforms:** 2 active features
- **Last Pulse:** 2026-01-24 23:46:17 UTC

## 🕹️ My Logic (In Simple Terms)
When I change, I generate a random-looking number from my latest update. Based on that number:
- **Even Number:** I grow a new "discovery" file.
- **Odd Number:** I remove my oldest "discovery" to make room.
- **Prime Number:** I reorganize and rename my internal files.
- **Lucky Multiples:** I might compress my data or update my manual.

## 🧐 Why exist?
This is a living experiment in **autonomous software**. It explores what happens when we let mathematics, rather than human whim, control the evolution of a digital system.
