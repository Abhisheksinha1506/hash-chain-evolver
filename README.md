# Hash Chain Evolver

A self-evolving repository driven by cryptographic determinism.

## Status

🌱 **Genesis phase complete**

Autonomous evolution will begin with the next scheduled run.

## How It Works

Each commit's SHA-256 hash deterministically controls the next evolution step.

See [EVOLUTION_LOG.md](EVOLUTION_LOG.md) for the full evolution history.

*No human intervention required. The chain evolves itself.*
