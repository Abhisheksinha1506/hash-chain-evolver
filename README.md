# 🧬 Hash Chain Evolver

### "A digital garden that grows by its own mathematical pulse."

**Hash Chain Evolver** is an autonomous code repository. Unlike normal software that humans write and update, this project changes itself automatically using its own "digital DNA" (commit hashes).

## 🏮 The Simple Analogy
Imagine a **self-playing piano**. Instead of a musician choosing the notes, the piano looks at the pattern of its last performance to decide what to play next. 

In this project:
1. Every hour, the system wakes up.
2. It looks at its latest "fingerprint" (the commit hash).
3. It uses that code to decide whether to **birth** a new file, **decay** an old one, or **evolve** its internal structure.

## 📊 Live Status
- **Evolution Age:** 6 steps
- **Current Lifeforms:** 2 active features
- **Last Pulse:** 2026-01-25 10:55:55 UTC

## 🕹️ The Rules of Growth
Every hour, a "mathematical pulse" (a number from 0-255) is extracted from the latest commit:
- **Even Number (BIRTH):** A new "discovery" file is created.
- **Odd Number (DECAY):** The oldest file is recycled to make room.
- **Prime Number (METAMORPHOSIS):** Internal files are renamed and reorganized.
- **Lucky Multiples (PURIFICATION):** Data is cleaned and optimized.

## 🧐 Why exist?
This is an experiment in **deterministic chaos**. It's built to see how a system can evolve into a complex structure without a single human decision. It's half-code, half-art, and entirely math.
