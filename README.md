# 🧬 Hash Chain Evolver

### "A digital garden that grows by its own mathematical pulse."

**Hash Chain Evolver** is an autonomous code repository. Unlike normal software that humans write and update, this project changes itself automatically using its own "digital DNA" (commit hashes).

## 🏮 The Simple Analogy
Imagine a **self-playing piano**. Instead of a musician choosing the notes, the piano looks at its last performance to decide what to play next. 

In this project:
1. Every hour, the system wakes up and feels its own "pulse."
2. This pulse is derived from its latest **Commit Hash** (a unique digital fingerprint).
3. Based on that fingerprint, it decides to **Birth** new code, **Decay** old parts, or **Metamorphose** its entire structure.

## 📊 Live Status
- **Evolution Age:** 729 steps
- **Genetic Integrity:** 0 Mutations Absorbed | 0 Discoveries Ingested
- **Active Discovery:** 0 features present
- **Current Vibe:** The garden is experiencing natural decay.

## 🕹️ The Rules of Growth
Every hour, a "mathematical pulse" (a number from 0-255) is extracted from the latest commit:
- **Even Number (BIRTH):** A new "discovery" file is created.
- **Odd Number (DECAY):** The oldest file is recycled to make room.
- **Prime Number (METAMORPHOSIS):** Internal files are renamed and reorganized.
- **Lucky Multiples (PURIFICATION):** Data is cleaned and optimized.
- **Pulse % 13 (INGESTION):** The system "hears" a human **Issue** and weaves it into the chain.
- **Pulse % 17 (MUTATION):** The system "absorbs" a **Pull Request** as a genetic mutation.

## 🤝 How to "Interact"
Even though the project is autonomous, you can still influence its growth:
- **Whisper an Idea:** Open an [Issue](../../issues). If the mathematical pulse matches (multiple of 13), your idea will be turned into a file automatically.
- **Propose a Mutation:** Submit a [Pull Request](../../pulls). If the system's pulse allows (multiple of 17), it will absorb your code into its history.

## 🧐 Why exist?
This is an experiment in **deterministic chaos**. It's built to see how a system can evolve into a complex structure without a single human decision. It's half-code, half-art, and entirely math.
