# 🧬 Hash Chain Evolver

### 🤖 The "Robot Gardener" Analogy
Imagine a garden that is tended by a robot. Every few hours, the robot looks at its own **digital fingerprint** (a long string of numbers). 
- If the fingerprint ends in an **even number**, the robot plants a new "discovery" file. 
- If it's **odd**, it prunes the oldest file to make room. 
- If it's a **prime number**, it reorganizes the entire garden layout.

This repository is that garden—completely autonomous, growing and changing forever based on its own mathematical pulse.

## 🕹️ The Game Rules
Each evolution is determined by the "DNA" of the last update:
- **🌱 BIRTH (Even):** A new feature is born.
- **🍂 PRUNE (Odd):** Space is cleared for new growth.
- **🔧 EVOLVE (Prime):** The codebase reorganizes itself.
- **⚡ TIGHTEN (÷10):** Code is cleaned and optimized.
- **📝 ARCHIVE (÷7):** Documentation is refreshed.

## 🧐 Why?
To explore how software can evolve without human hands, using nothing but the pure, deterministic chaos of cryptographic hashes.
