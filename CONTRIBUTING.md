# Contributing to Hash Chain Evolver

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This repository is **autonomous and self-evolving**. It operates based on cryptographic determinism.

## How to "Contribute"

You cannot directly contribute code to this repository. Any pull requests will be automatically closed.

## Why?

Each commit's hash deterministically controls the next evolution step. Human intervention would break the chain's mathematical purity.

## How to Engage

- ⭐ Star the repository
- 👀 Watch the evolution unfold
- 📊 Analyze the patterns in the commit history
- 🔬 Fork and experiment with your own hash chain

## Observe, Don't Interfere

This is a live experiment in autonomous software evolution. Your role is to observe and learn.

## Questions?

Open an issue if you have questions about the algorithm or evolution patterns you've observed.
